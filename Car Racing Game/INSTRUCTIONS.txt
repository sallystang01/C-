//This is documentation:
	https://www.mooict.com/c-tutorial-top-down-car-racing-game-with-visual-studio/
	
	Follow the steps and by the end you will have a running racing game. 
	
	Notice!!!!!!!!!
		Everything in the the tutorial is straight forward but you might
		be confused when you see the following:
			ChangeAI1();
			ChangeAI2();
			Gameover();
		Whenever you run across this (you will know when you run across it), ignore the red line
			and just keep coding. It will come together later on.
			
			Enjoy! If you do this game then I would recommend trying out the other games just because
			they help me understand c# and I think it might help others too.
